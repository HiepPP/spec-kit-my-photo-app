   - Verify no accessibility violations are reported

### Using axe-core Testing

Add to your test files:
```typescript
import { axe, toHaveNoViolations } from 'jest-axe'

expect.extend(toHaveNoViolations)

test('AlbumGrid should not have accessibility violations', async () => {
  const { container } = render(<AlbumGrid albums={mockAlbums} onAlbumClick={jest.fn()} />)
  const results = await axe(container)
  expect(results).toHaveNoViolations()
})
```

## Test Cases Checklist
