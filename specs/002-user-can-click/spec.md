3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’ Navigation: How to enter/exit detail view [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
   ’ Image details: What specific metadata to show [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’ User journey identified: browse ’ click ’ view detail ’ return
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’ Requirements testable and marked where unclear
6. Identify Key Entities
   ’ Image entity with metadata
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’ Spec has uncertainties marked
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ¡ Quick Guidelines

-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements

- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story

As a photo app user, I want to click on any image to view its details in a focused view, so I can see the image larger and access its metadata without distraction from other photos.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** I am viewing photos in the main gallery, **When** I click on any image, **Then** I am taken to a detail page showing only that image

2. **Given** I am on the image detail page, **When** the page loads, **Then** I see a 2-column layout with the image displayed on the left side and image details on the right side

3. **Given** I am viewing image details, **When** I look at the details column, **Then** I can see who uploaded the image and the capture date/time

4. **Given** I am on the image detail page, **When** I want to return to the gallery, **Then** there is a way to navigate back [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: back button, X button, or other?]

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the image metadata is missing or incomplete?
- How does the view handle very large images?
- What happens when the user tries to access a deleted image's detail page?
- How does the layout adapt on mobile devices where 2 columns may not fit?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to click on any image to view its detailed information
- **FR-002**: System MUST display the selected image in an isolated view, showing only that single image
- **FR-003**: System MUST present the detail view in a 2-column layout format
- **FR-004**: System MUST display the image in the left column of the detail view
- **FR-005**: System MUST display image metadata in the right column of the detail view
- **FR-006**: System MUST show who uploaded the image as part of the metadata [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: display name, username, or other identifier?]
- **FR-007**: System MUST show the image capture date and time as part of the metadata
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide a way for users to navigate from the detail view back to the main gallery [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific navigation method?]
- **FR-009**: System MUST handle cases where image metadata is incomplete or missing

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Image**: Represents a single photo with associated metadata including uploader information and capture timestamp
- **Image Metadata**: Contains supplementary information about the image including uploader identity and capture date/time
