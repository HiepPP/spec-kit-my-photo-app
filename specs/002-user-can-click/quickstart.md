# Quick Start Guide: Image Detail View Feature

This guide demonstrates how to use the new image detail view functionality.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ installed
- Photo app running locally
- At least one image uploaded to your gallery

## Basic Usage

### 1. Navigate to Gallery

Open the photo app and go to the main gallery view where you can see all your photos.

### 2. Click on an Image

Click any image thumbnail to open the detail view.

```bash
# The modal should open showing:
# - Full-size image on the left
# - Image details on the right
```

### 3. View Image Details

The right column displays:
- **Uploader**: Username of who uploaded the image
- **Upload Date**: When the image was added to the app
- **Capture Date**: When the photo was taken (from EXIF data)
- **File Size**: Human-readable size (e.g., "2.4 MB")
- **Dimensions**: Width × height in pixels
- **Camera Model**: If available in EXIF data
- **File Type**: e.g., "JPEG", "PNG"

### 4. Close the Detail View

Use any of these methods to close:
- Click the × button in the top-right corner
- Click outside the modal (on the dark overlay)
- Press the ESC key

## Keyboard Navigation

- **Tab**: Navigate between interactive elements
- **Enter/Space**: Activate focused buttons
- **ESC**: Close the detail view
- **Arrow Keys**: Navigate between images in slideshow mode (future enhancement)

## Accessibility Features

- All buttons have ARIA labels
- Modal traps focus when open
- Screen reader announces when modal opens/closes
- Full keyboard navigation support

## Testing the Feature

### Manual Testing

1. **Open Detail View**
   - Click various images
   - Verify correct image loads
   - Check metadata displays correctly

2. **Close Modal**
   - Test all close methods (×, outside click, ESC)
   - Verify focus returns to clicked image

3. **Accessibility**
   - Test with screen reader (VoiceOver, NVDA)
   - Navigate with keyboard only
   - Verify ARIA labels are descriptive

4. **Responsive Design**
   - Test on mobile device (layout should stack)
   - Test on tablet and desktop
   - Verify text remains readable

### Automated Testing

Run the test suite:

```bash
npm test
```

Key test files:
- `ImageDetailModal.test.tsx` - Component tests
- `ImageGallery.test.tsx` - Integration tests
- `useImageDetail.test.ts` - Hook tests
- `accessibility.test.tsx` - Accessibility tests

## Troubleshooting

### Image Not Loading

1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify image file exists in storage
3. Check file permissions

### Missing Metadata

1. Some images may not have EXIF data
2. Upload date should always show
3. File size and type should always be available

### Modal Not Opening

1. Check JavaScript console for errors
2. Verify React is running without errors
3. Check CSS is loaded correctly
