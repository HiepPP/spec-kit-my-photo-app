# Research: Image Detail View Feature

**Feature**: Image Detail View (002-user-can-click)
**Date**: 2025-09-26

## Decisions Made

### Navigation Method
**Decision**: Implement a modal/overlay for detail view instead of separate page
**Rationale**:
- Provides better user experience with instant view without page reload
- Maintains gallery context in background
- Easier to implement with existing React router setup
- More responsive on mobile devices

**Alternatives considered**:
- Separate page route: More traditional but requires full page transition
- Side panel: Could work but reduces image visibility

### Uploader Information Display
**Decision**: Display "Uploaded by [username]" with optional real name if available
**Rationale**:
- Clear and concise
- Follows common social media patterns
- Privacy-preserving (username instead of email)

**Alternatives considered**:
- Full name only: Could expose private information
- Email address: Privacy violation

### Metadata Fields to Display
**Decision**:
- Upload date/time (formatted)
- File size
- Image dimensions (width × height)
- Camera model (if available in EXIF)
- File type

**Rationale**: Comprehensive but not overwhelming

### Back Navigation
**Decision**:
- Close button (×) in top-right corner
- Click outside modal to close
- ESC key support
- Optional back arrow in top-left

**Rationale**: Multiple intuitive ways to exit detail view

### Mobile Responsiveness
**Decision**: Stack layout on mobile (image above, details below)
**Rationale**: Better use of limited screen space

### Image Loading Strategy
**Decision**: Lazy loading with placeholder
**Rationale**: Better performance for large images

### Accessibility Considerations
**Decision**:
- ARIA labels for all interactive elements
- Keyboard navigation support
- Focus management when opening/closing
- Screen reader announcements

**Rationale**: Required by constitution and WCAG 2.1 AA

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Component Structure
- `ImageDetailModal`: Main component for detail view
- `ImageGallery`: Modified to handle click events
- `ImageMetadata`: Component for displaying metadata

### State Management
- Use React context for selected image state
- Local state for modal open/close

### Styling
- Use Tailwind CSS for responsive layout
- Shadcn/ui components for buttons and close button

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for all components
- Integration tests for navigation flow
- Accessibility tests with axe-core

## All NEEDS CLARIFICATION Resolved

- ✅ Navigation method: Modal with multiple exit options
- ✅ Uploader info: Username with optional real name
- ✅ Back navigation: Close button, click outside, ESC key
