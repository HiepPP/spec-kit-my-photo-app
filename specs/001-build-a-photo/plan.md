# Implementation Plan: Photo Organizer App

**Branch**: `001-build-a-photo` | **Date**: 2025-09-23 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-build-a-photo/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)

```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI, `QWEN.md` for Qwen Code or `AGENTS.md` for opencode).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:

- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary

Photo organizer app with React UI component hierarchy including AlbumGrid, AlbumTile, PhotoTileView, ZoomModal, and UploadDropzone components. Uses shadcn/ui integration with drag-and-drop functionality for album reordering. Auto-groups photos by EXIF capture date with local SQLite storage.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: TypeScript with React.js 18+
**Primary Dependencies**: React, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui, Vite, @dnd-kit/core for drag-drop
**Storage**: SQLite with local file storage only
**Testing**: Vitest with React Testing Library for 100% coverage
**Target Platform**: Modern web browsers (Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+)
**Project Type**: single - React SPA with local data persistence
**Performance Goals**: <100ms UI interactions, smooth 60fps drag animations
**Constraints**: Offline-capable, no cloud storage, WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility
**Scale/Scope**: Single-user desktop/mobile web app, ~1000 photos per album

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**✅ React Component Architecture**: UI plan focuses on functional components with hooks (AlbumGrid, AlbumTile, PhotoTileView, ZoomModal, UploadDropzone)

**✅ 100% Test Coverage**: TDD approach with Vitest + React Testing Library for all components

**✅ Accessibility First**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance with ARIA labels, semantic HTML, keyboard navigation

**✅ Local SQLite Storage**: All photo/album data persisted locally, no cloud dependencies

**✅ Modern React Ecosystem**: React 18+, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui components, Vite build

**Structure Decision**: Option 1 (Single project) - React SPA with local storage

## Phase 0: Outline & Research

1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:

   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts

*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each user action → endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Each story → integration test scenario
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh claude`
     **IMPORTANT**: Execute it exactly as specified above. Do not add or remove any arguments.
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach

*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:

- Generate UI component tasks from React component hierarchy
- Create service layer tasks for PhotoService contract
- Database setup and migration tasks for SQLite schema
- Testing tasks for 100% coverage requirement
- Accessibility validation tasks for WCAG compliance

**Ordering Strategy**:

- Setup: Project initialization, dependencies, database schema
- Tests First: Component tests, service tests (TDD)
- Core Components: AlbumGrid, AlbumTile, PhotoTileView [P]
- Supporting Components: ZoomModal, UploadDropzone [P]
- Service Layer: PhotoService implementation, SQLite integration
- Integration: Drag-and-drop, ZIP export, error handling
- Polish: Accessibility, performance, documentation

**Estimated Output**: 30-35 numbered, ordered tasks focusing on UI component hierarchy

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation

*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking

*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |

## Progress Tracking

*This checklist is updated during execution flow*

**Phase Status**:

- [x] Phase 0: Research complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 1: Design complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 2: Task planning complete (/plan command - describe approach only)
- [ ] Phase 3: Tasks generated (/tasks command)
- [ ] Phase 4: Implementation complete
- [ ] Phase 5: Validation passed

**Gate Status**:

- [x] Initial Constitution Check: PASS
- [x] Post-Design Constitution Check: PASS
