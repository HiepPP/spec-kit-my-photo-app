# Tasks: Photo Organizer App - Main Landing Page

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-build-a-photo/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

## Format: `[ID] [P?] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **Single project**: `src/`, `tests/` at repository root (React SPA)
- Paths assume single project structure per plan.md

- [x] T032 [P] Implement focus management for infinite scroll
- [x] T033 [P] Add loading states with proper ARIA live regions
- [x] T034 [P] Create Storybook stories for AlbumGrid and AlbumTile components
- [x] T035 Test with screen reader and keyboard-only navigation

## Phase 3.9: Integration and Performance

- [ ] T036 Add performance monitoring for infinite scroll performance
- [ ] T037 Implement virtualization for large album lists (react-window integration)
- [ ] T038 Add image preloading for smooth user experience
- [ ] T039 Optimize bundle size and implement code splitting

## Phase 3.10: Testing and Validation

- [ ] T040 [P] Run full test suite and achieve 100% coverage
- [ ] T041 [P] Execute Lighthouse performance audit (target: 90+ scores)
- [ ] T042 [P] Validate WCAG 2.1 AA compliance with axe-core
- [ ] T043 Manual testing of 3-column responsive grid on different screen sizes
- [ ] T044 Load testing with 1000+ mock albums for infinite scroll performance

## Dependencies

**Setup Dependencies**:
- T001 blocks T002-T006
- T007-T010 must complete before T011-T014
- T011-T014 (tests) must complete before T015-T044

**Component Dependencies**:
- T015-T018 (layout) before T019-T022 (album components)
- T019-T020 (AlbumTile) before T021-T022 (AlbumGrid)
- T023-T024 (infinite scroll hook) before T025-T026 (integration)
- T027-T028 (data service) before T029-T030 (connection)

**Parallel Execution Groups**:
- Setup: T003, T004, T005, T006
- Mock Data: T007, T008, T009, T010
- Tests: T011, T012, T013, T014
- Components: T019, T020 (different files)
- Services: T027, T028 (different concerns)
- Polish: T031, T032, T033, T034, T040, T041, T042

## Parallel Execution Examples

```
# Launch T007-T010 together for mock data setup:
Task: "Create mock album data generator in src/mocks/albums.ts"
Task: "Create TypeScript interfaces in src/types/index.ts from contracts"
Task: "Setup test utilities and custom render functions in tests/utils.tsx"
Task: "Create mock photo data with thumbnail URLs in src/mocks/photos.ts"
```

```
# Launch T011-T014 together for test creation:
Task: "Album Grid component test in tests/components/AlbumGrid.test.tsx"
Task: "Album Tile component test in tests/components/AlbumTile.test.tsx"
Task: "Infinite scroll hook test in tests/hooks/useInfiniteScroll.test.tsx"
Task: "Mock data service test in tests/services/MockDataService.test.tsx"
```

## Notes

- **Mock Data First**: All components use mock data before database integration
- **3-Column Grid**: CSS Grid with responsive breakpoints for desktop/tablet/mobile
- **Infinite Loading**: Uses IntersectionObserver API for performance
- **TDD Enforced**: All tests must fail before implementation begins
- **Accessibility Required**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance validated before completion
- **Performance Target**: 60fps scrolling, <100ms interaction times

## Task Generation Rules Applied

1. **From Contracts**: AlbumGridProps and AlbumTileProps → component tests and implementations
2. **From Data Model**: Album entity → mock data generation and TypeScript interfaces
3. **From User Requirements**: 3-column grid + infinite loading → specific UI implementation tasks
4. **From Constitutional Requirements**: 100% test coverage + accessibility → comprehensive testing tasks

## Validation Checklist

- [x] All component contracts have corresponding tests
- [x] All UI requirements have implementation tasks
- [x] All tests come before implementation (TDD)
- [x] Parallel tasks are truly independent files
- [x] Each task specifies exact file path
- [x] No task modifies same file as another [P] task
- [x] Landing page focus with 3-column grid and infinite loading addressed
