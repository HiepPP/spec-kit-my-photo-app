# Feature Specification: Photo Organizer App

**Feature Branch**: `001-build-a-photo`
**Created**: 2025-09-23
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Build a photo organizer app. Users upload local photos (no cloud storage). Auto-group into albums by capture date. Main view: Grid of albums with thumbnails; drag-and-drop to reorder albums (flat structureno nesting). Inside an album: Tile-view photo previews with zoom on click. Export albums as ZIP."

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story

A user wants to organize their local photo collection without cloud dependency. They upload photos from their device, and the system automatically groups them into albums by capture date. They can see all albums in a grid layout, reorder them by dragging, browse photos within each album, and export complete albums as ZIP files for backup or sharing.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** no photos are uploaded, **When** user accesses the main view, **Then** an empty grid is displayed with upload instructions
2. **Given** photos are uploaded, **When** photos have different capture dates, **Then** separate albums are automatically created for each date
3. **Given** multiple albums exist, **When** user drags an album tile, **Then** albums reorder and maintain new position
4. **Given** user clicks on an album, **When** album opens, **Then** tile view shows all photos from that album
5. **Given** user clicks on a photo tile, **When** photo opens, **Then** zoomed view displays with navigation controls
6. **Given** user selects an album, **When** export is triggered, **Then** ZIP file downloads with all album photos

### Edge Cases

- What happens when photos lack EXIF capture date metadata?
- How does system handle duplicate photos (same file, same date)?
- What occurs when user attempts to drag album during upload process?
- How does system behave with corrupted or unsupported image files?
- What happens when export fails due to insufficient storage space?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to upload multiple photo files from local device storage
- **FR-002**: System MUST automatically extract capture date from photo EXIF metadata
- **FR-003**: System MUST automatically group photos into albums based on capture date (one album per date)
- **FR-004**: System MUST display albums in a grid layout with thumbnail previews
- **FR-005**: System MUST enable drag-and-drop reordering of album tiles
- **FR-006**: System MUST maintain flat album structure with no nested folders
- **FR-007**: System MUST show tile-view photo previews when album is opened
- **FR-008**: System MUST display zoomed photo view when individual photo is clicked
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide navigation controls in zoomed view (next, previous, close)
- **FR-010**: System MUST export selected albums as ZIP files for download
- **FR-011**: System MUST persist photo organization and album order locally
- **FR-012**: System MUST handle photos without EXIF date by [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: default album strategy - upload date, "Unknown Date" album, or user prompt?]
- **FR-013**: System MUST support common image formats [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific formats - JPEG, PNG, HEIC, RAW files?]
- **FR-014**: System MUST prevent data loss during [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: error scenarios - browser refresh, network issues, storage full?]

### Key Entities

- **Photo**: Individual image file with metadata (filename, capture date, file size, dimensions, upload timestamp)
- **Album**: Collection of photos grouped by capture date with display order, thumbnail image, photo count
- **Upload Session**: Temporary state during photo import with progress tracking, error handling
